I created a deep copy of both lists to calculate the union . The end of the first list is then pointed to the start of the second.
For the intersecion, I used a hash map with the key being the node value and the value being the number of occurences.
With the first list, I populated the hash map and then iterated through the second to find matches.

Time complexities
union - O(n)
Intersection - O(n)

Space complexities
union - O(n)
Intersection - O(n)
